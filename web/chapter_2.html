            <h1>Introduction to C</h1>
            This tutorial is designed to be a stand-alone introduction to C, even if you've
            never programmed before. However, because C++ is a more modern language, if
            you're not sure if you should learn C or C++, I recommend the <a
                href="//www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html">C++ tutorial</a>
            instead, which is also designed for people who have never programmed before. Nevertheless, if you do not
            desire some of C++'s advanced features or
            simply wish to learn C instead of C++, then this tutorial is for you!
            <br><br>
            <h2>Getting set up - finding a C compiler</h2>
            The very first thing you need to do, before starting out in C, is to make
            sure that you have a compiler. What is a compiler, you ask? A
            compiler turns the program that you write into an <b>executable</b> that
            your computer can actually understand and run.

            If you're taking a course, you probably have
            one provided through your school.
            <br><br>

            If you haven't yet done so, go ahead and get a compiler set up--you'll need it for the rest of the tutorial.
            If you're on Windows, your best bet is
            to use <a href="//www.cprogramming.com/code_blocks/">Code::Blocks with MinGW</a>. If you're on Linux, you
            can use <a href="https://www.cprogramming.com/gcc.html">gcc</a>, and if you're on Mac OS X, you can use <a
                href="https://www.cprogramming.com/xcode.html">XCode</a>.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Intro to C</h2>
            Every full C program begins inside a function called "main". A function is
            simply a collection of commands that do "something". The main function is
            always called when the program first executes. From main, we can call other
            functions, whether they be written by us or by others or use built-in language
            features. To access the standard functions that comes with your compiler, you
            need to include a header with the #include directive. What this does is
            effectively take everything in the header and paste it into your program.
            Let's look at a working program:

                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </div>
            </div>
            Let's look at the elements of the program. The #include is a "preprocessor"
            directive that tells the compiler to put code from the header called stdio.h
            into our program before actually creating the executable. By including header
            files, you can gain access to many different functions--both the
            printf and getchar functions are included in stdio.h.

            <br><br>
            The next important line is int main(). This line tells the compiler that there
            is a function named main, and that the function returns an integer, hence int.
            The "curly braces" ({ and }) signal the beginning and end of functions and other
            code blocks. If you have programmed in Pascal, you will know them as BEGIN and
            END. Even if you haven't programmed in Pascal, this is a good way to think
            about their meaning.
            <br><br>
            The printf function is the standard C way of displaying output on the screen.
            The quotes tell the compiler that you want to output the literal string as-is
            (almost). The '\n' sequence is actually treated as a single character that
            stands for a newline (we'll talk about this later in more detail); for the
            time being, just remember that there are a few sequences that, when they
            appear in a string literal, are actually not displayed literally by printf and
            that '\n' is one of them. The actual effect of '\n' is to move the cursor on
            your screen to the next line. Notice the semicolon: it tells the compiler that
            you're at the end of a command, such as a function call. You will see that the semicolon is used
            to end many lines in C.
            <br><br>
            The next command is getchar(). This is another function call: it reads in
            a single character and waits for the user to hit enter before reading the
            character. This line is included because many compiler environments will open
            a new console window, run the program, and then close the window before you
            can see the output. This command keeps that window from closing because the
            program is not done yet because it waits for you to hit enter. Including that
            line gives you time to see the program run.

            <br><br>
            Finally, at the end of the program, we return a value from main to
            the operating system by using the return statement. This return value is
            important as it can be used to tell the operating system whether our program succeeded or
            not. A return value of 0 means success.

            <br><br>
            The final brace closes off the function. You should try compiling this program
            and running it. You can cut and paste the code into a file, save it as a .c
            file, and then compile it. If you are using a command-line compiler, such as
            Borland C++ 5.5, you should read the compiler instructions for information on
            how to compile. Otherwise compiling and running should be as simple as
            clicking a button with your mouse (perhaps the "build" or "run" button).

            <br><br> You might start playing around with the printf function and get used to
            writing simple C programs.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Explaining your Code</h2>
            Comments are critical for all but the most trivial programs and this tutorial
            will often use them to explain sections of code. When you tell the
            compiler a section of text is a comment, it will ignore it when running the
            code, allowing you to use any text you want to describe the real code. To
            create a comment in C, you surround the text with /* and then */ to block off
            everything between as a comment. Certain compiler environments or <a
                href="//www.cprogramming.com/texteditors.html">text editors</a> will change
            the color of a commented area to make it easier to spot, but some will not. Be
            certain not to accidentally comment out code (that is, to tell the compiler
            part of your code is a comment) you need for the program.

            <br><br>
            When you are learning to program, it is also useful to comment out
            sections of code in order to see how the output is affected.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Using Variables</h2>
            So far you should be able to write a simple program to display information
            typed in by you, the programmer and to describe your program with comments.
            That's great, but what about interacting with your user? Fortunately, it is
            also possible for your program to accept input.

            <br><br>
            But first, before you try to receive input, you must have a place to store
            that input. In programming, input and data are stored in variables. There are
            several different types of variables; when you tell the compiler you are
            declaring a variable, you must include the data type along with the name of
            the variable. Several basic types include char, int, and float. Each type
            can store different types of data.

            <br><br> A variable of type char stores a
            single character, variables of type int store integers (numbers without
            decimal places), and variables of type float store numbers with decimal
            places. Each of these variable types - char, int, and float - is each a
            keyword that you use when you declare a variable. Some variables also use
            more of the computer's memory to store their values.

            <br><br>
            It may seem strange to have multiple variable types when it seems like some
            variable types are redundant. But using the right variable size can be
            important for making your program efficient because some variables require
            more memory than others. For now, suffice it to say that the different
            variable types will almost all be used!

            <br><br>
            Before you can use a variable, you must tell the compiler about it by
            declaring it and telling the compiler about what its "type" is. To declare a
            variable you use the syntax &lt;variable type&gt; &lt;name of variable&gt;;.
            (The brackets here indicate that your replace the expression with text
            described within the brackets.) For instance, a basic variable declaration
            might look like this:

            <div>
                <div class="syntaxhighlighter  cpp">
                    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">

            Note once again the use of a semicolon at the end of the line. Even though
            we're not calling a function, a semicolon is still required at the end of the
            "expression". This code would create a variable called myVariable; now we are free to use myVariable later
            in the program.

            It is permissible to declare multiple variables of the same type on the same
            line; each one should be separated by a comma. If you attempt to use an
            undefined variable, your program will not run, and you will receive an error
            message informing you that you have made a mistake. <br><br>

            While you can have multiple variables of the same type, you cannot have
            multiple variables with the same name. Moreover, you cannot have variables and
            functions with the same name.

            <h2>Reading input</h2>
            Using variables in C for input or output can be a bit of a hassle at first,
            but bear with it and it will make sense. We'll be using the scanf function to
            read in a value and then printf to read it back out. Let's look at the
            program and then pick apart exactly what's going on. You can even compile
            this and run it if it helps you follow along.

            So what does all of this mean? We've seen the #include and main function
            before; main must appear in every program you intend to run, and the #include
            gives us access to printf (as well as scanf). (As you might have guessed,
            the io in stdio.h stands for "input/output"; std just stands for "standard.")
            The keyword int declares this_is_a_number to be an integer. <br><br>

            This is where things start to get interesting: the scanf function works by
            taking a string and some variables modified with &amp;. The string tells
            scanf what variables to look for: notice that we have a string containing only
            "%d" -- this tells the scanf function to read in an integer. The second
            argument of scanf is the variable, sort of. We'll learn more about what is
            going on later, but the gist of it is that scanf needs to know where the
            variable is stored in order to change its value. Using &amp; in front of a
            variable allows you to get its location and give that to scanf instead of the
            value of the variable. Think of it like giving someone directions to the
            soda aisle and letting them go get a coca-cola instead of fetching the coke
            for that person. The &amp; gives the scanf function directions to the
            variable.

            <br><br>
            When the program runs, each call to scanf checks its own input string to see
            what kinds of input to expect, and then stores the value input into the
            variable.

            <br><br>
            The second printf statement also contains the same '%d'--both scanf and printf
            use the same format for indicating values embedded in strings. In this case,
            printf takes the first argument after the string, the variable
            this_is_a_number, and treats it as though it were of the type specified by the
            "format specifier". In this case, printf treats this_is_a_number as an
            integer based on the format specifier.

            <br><br>
            So what does it mean to treat a number as an integer? If the user attempts to
            type in a decimal number, it will be truncated (that is, the decimal component
            of the number will be ignored) when stored in the variable. Try typing in a
            sequence of characters or a decimal number when you run the example program;
            the response will vary from input to input, but in no case is it particularly
            pretty.

            <br><br>
            Of course, no matter what type you use, variables are uninteresting without
            the ability to modify them. Several operators used with variables include the
            following: *, -, +, /, =, ==, &gt;, &lt;. The * multiplies, the / divides, the - subtracts,
            and the + adds. It is of course important to realize that to modify the value
            of a variable inside the program it is rather important to use the equal sign.
            In some languages, the equal sign compares the value of the left and right
            values, but in C == is used for that task. The equal sign is still extremely
            useful. It sets the value of the variable on the left side of the equals sign
            equal to the value on the right side of the equals sign. The
            operators that perform mathematical functions should be used on the right side
            of an equal sign in order to assign the result to a variable on the left side.

            The other form of equal, ==, is not a way to assign a value to a variable.
            Rather, it checks to see if the variables are equal. It is extremely useful in
            many areas of C; for example, you will often use == in such constructions as
            conditional statements and loops. You can probably guess how &lt; and &gt;
            function. They are greater than and less than operators.

            <div>
