            <h1>Algorithm</h1>
            In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/) is a finite
            sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a
            computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. By
            making use of artificial intelligence, algorithms can perform automated deductions (referred to as automated
            reasoning) and use mathematical and logical tests to divert the code through various routes (referred to as
            automated decision-making). Using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was
            already practiced by Alan Turing with terms such as "memory", "search" and "stimulus".
            <br>
            As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time, and in a
            well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial
            input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a
            finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a
            final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some
            algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.
            <br><br>
            <h1>Informal definition</h1>
            An informal definition could be "a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations", which
            would include all computer programs (including programs that do not perform
            numeric calculations), and (for example) any prescribed bureaucratic procedure or cook-book recipe.
            <br><br>
            In general, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually—even though infinite loops may
            sometimes prove desirable.
            <br><br>
            A prototypical example of an algorithm is the Euclidean algorithm, which is used to determine the maximum
            common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the flowchart above and as an
            example in a later section.
            <br><br>
            Boolos, Jeffrey & 1974, 1999 offer an informal meaning of the word "algorithm" in the following quotation:
            <br><br>
            <i>
                No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †"smaller and smaller without
                limit
                ... you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably
                infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do
                something
                equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give explicit instructions for
                determining the nth member of the set, for arbitrary finite n. Such instructions are to be given quite
                explicitly, in a form in which they could be followed by a computing machine, or by a human who is
                capable
                of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.
            </i>
            <br><br>
            An "enumerably infinite set" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the
            integers. Thus Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that
            "creates" output integers from an arbitrary "input" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily
            large. For example, an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as y = m + n (i.e., two arbitrary "input
            variables" m and n that produce an output y), but various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate
            that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):

            Precise instructions (in a language understood by "the computer") for a fast, efficient, "good"
            process that specifies the "moves" of "the computer" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary
            internally contained information and capabilities) to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input
            integers/symbols m and n, symbols + and = ... and "effectively" produce, in a "reasonable" time,
            output-integer y at a specified place and in a specified format.

            The concept of algorithm is also used to define the notion of decidability—a notion that is central for
            explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules. In logic, the
            time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related to the
            customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the
            unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of
            the term.

            Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs. However, algorithms are also
            implemented by other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain
            implementing arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an electrical circuit, or in a mechanical device.
            <br><br>
            <h1>Expressing algorithms</h1>
            <br>
            Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including natural languages, pseudocode, flowcharts,
            drakon-charts, programming languages or control tables (processed by interpreters). Natural language
            expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical
            algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and control tables are structured ways to express
            algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in the statements based on natural language.
            Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a
            computer, but are also often used as a way to define or document algorithms.

            There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given Turing machine program as a
            sequence of machine tables (see finite-state machine, state transition table and control table for more), as
            flowcharts and drakon-charts (see state diagram for more), or as a form of rudimentary machine code or
            assembly code called "sets of quadruples" (see Turing machine for more).

            Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description, as
            follows:
            <br>
            <b>1 High-level description</b>
            "...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level, we do not need to
            mention how the machine manages its tape or head."
            <br>
            <b>2 Implementation description</b>
            "...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its
            tape. At this level, we do not give details of states or transition function."
            <br>
            <b>3 Formal description</b>
            Most detailed, "lowest level", gives the Turing machine's "state table".
